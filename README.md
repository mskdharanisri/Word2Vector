Project Overview
This project implements a simple word embedding model using both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The goal is to train a model to learn embeddings from a given corpus and make predictions based on word context. The model uses one-hot encoding for input data, calculates word embeddings, and utilizes a neural network to learn relationships between words based on their context.

Features
Word Embedding Creation: The script processes a given text corpus, extracts unique words, and generates one-hot encoded vectors for training.
Model Implementation: The project includes implementations in both TensorFlow and PyTorch to provide flexibility and demonstrate usage in different frameworks.
Training Loop: The script trains the model on the training data using a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.x
Required Libraries:
TensorFlow (for TensorFlow implementation)
PyTorch (for PyTorch implementation)
NumPy
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow torch numpy
Usage
Prepare Your Corpus:

The corpus is defined as a string in the script. Modify the corpus_raw variable to include your own text data.
python
Copy code
corpus_raw = 'Hello World. Hello hi. hello queen'
Run the Script:

Save the script in a file, e.g., word_embedding_model.py.
Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt:
bash
Copy code
python word_embedding_model.py
View Output:

The training loss will be printed to the console during training iterations.
Example Corpus
You can modify the corpus_raw variable with any text you wish to analyze. Here's a sample:

python
Copy code
corpus_raw = 'This is a sample corpus. It includes several words for testing.'
Understanding the Code
Corpus Processing: The corpus is converted to lowercase and split into sentences. Each sentence is then split into words to create the vocabulary.

One-Hot Encoding: A function to_one_hot converts word indices into one-hot encoded vectors based on the vocabulary size.

Word2Vec-like Model: The model consists of an embedding layer and a fully connected layer. It learns to predict context words based on target words.

Training Loop: The model is trained for a specified number of iterations, and the loss is printed at each step.

Sample Output
During the training process, you will see the loss printed to the console. For example:

makefile
Copy code
Loss: 0.6931
Loss: 0.6928
...
Conclusion
This project provides a basic foundation for understanding word embeddings and context prediction using neural networks. You can further enhance it by integrating larger datasets, experimenting with different hyperparameters, and implementing advanced models like Skip-gram or CBOW.
